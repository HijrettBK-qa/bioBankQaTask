Automation Test Analyst – Pre Interview Test

Using the “Google Keep” application 

Please write a series of Tests that you would perform if you were testing this application

Use Playwright https://playwright.dev/  (with either javascript or typescript) to create these tests
We are not expecting an exhaustive list of tests but a good sample of what you would run so we can discuss these during the interview.

Note
You will be judged on the code quality and project layout, so pay attention to details, just like you would do for a real-life application. There is no time limit for this take-home exercise. Upon receiving your solution, we will review it and provide feedback.
 
We would appreciate any ideas on how you would make the test automation more production-ready, even if you don’t have the time to implement them.
